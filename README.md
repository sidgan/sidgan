# Siddha Ganju

Currently, I am an Architect at Nvidia focusing on the Self-Driving initiative. I work towards stable and scalable training of neural networks on very large data centers, and utilize simulation to validate the neural networks.

In 2017 I led NASA's Long-Period Comets team within their AI accelerator, called Frontier Development Lab, where we use machine learning to develop meteor detectors. Recently this project was able to provide the first-ever instrumental evidence of an outburst of 5 meteors coming from a previously known comet, called C/1907 G1 (Grigg-Mellish). As a member of the NASA FDL AI Technical Committee, I'm working towards incorporating AI in many space science projects!

I have also authored a book on Practical Deep Learning for Cloud, Mobile & Edge - O'Reilly Publishers
